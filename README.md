This is the code and report submission for Team 6 for Citadel's 2025 Womens Datathon: Isha Goswami, Kalash Bhaiya, Nanxi Jiang, Raven (Ruiwen) Tang. 
This project analyzes the trends and impacts of gentrification across U.S. metropolitan areas between 2013 and 2023, focusing on income shifts, housing affordability, and demographic changes. Using the Ellen O’Regan model, we classify zip codes that have undergone gentrification based on relative income growth within their metropolitan areas.

Data Sources
	•	Zillow: Housing market trends and affordability data.
	•	American Community Survey (ACS): Income, demographic, and housing data.
	•	U.S. Census Bureau: Additional socioeconomic indicators.

Key Findings
	•	We observed significant gentrification in cities like Miami, where socioeconomic factors and climate change are playing a role in displacement.
	•	By mapping income and housing trends, this study provides a deeper understanding of the long-term effects of gentrification on communities and urban policy.

The code used in this analysis integrates these data sources, processes the relevant indicators, and visualizes the results to assess gentrification patterns across different regions.
